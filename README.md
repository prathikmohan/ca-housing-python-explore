## ca-housing-python-explore

Using data science descriptive statistics in python to explore the housing data in California. The data set has collected information on the variables of all block groups in California from the 1990 U.S. Census. We use filtering, iloc, aggression, groupby, slicing and other descriptive stats on this .csv.

Tool: I initially used Google Collab to write this code, later switched to Jupyter Notebook (conda 4.9.2).

System: Linux (Ubuntu) 20.04.01 Focal Fossa
